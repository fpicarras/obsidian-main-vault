# HackerSchool

Some more work to be done today in the lab, labeling I believe, then I'll have the day off (also I woke up late so yey... This could already be done)

# Minecraft Server

It has begun, my will to start over again... I promise myself that we would stick in this server for some years to come but... here we are. I will not change it tho... I already made so much stuff and if I keep changing worlds I'll never achieve the level of *lore* I want.

I'll work on the sap factory and start the main complex... still have little ideas on what to do...
