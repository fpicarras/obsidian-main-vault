Some house cleaning was done today, the lab is starting to look good. We still need to see what material and tools we lack and buy it...

We got an Agilent Oscilloscope, old but gold, digital and all. Then came the idea of a desk shelf (like the ones in the eletronic's labs)... our desks are too small (170x70) for the available shelves (180 cm) so making the shelf myself at home with some wood wouldn't such a bad idea:
