Started using obsidian,  honestly look good and I'll have to better config this to sync with every device (Android will be a pain from what I've read).

I want to use this not only for note taking but also to create road-maps for projects, like the *lore* for my Minecraft Server... that would be fun :)

So, this is what i must do:

- [ ] Configure the *sync* mechanism;
- [ ] Create a daily notations *template* (not too fancy)
