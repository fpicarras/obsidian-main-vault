> The main ideia for SIMD - **Single Instruction Multiple Data** - is that most of the time we process data with the same instructions, so we modify the hardware so that with a single instruction stream, we can operate in multiple positions of an array at a time - allowing for effective parallelization of an array processing on a hart
