# Intro

The **message passing model** is a parallel programming paradigm where threads or processes do not share memory but instead communicate by sending and receiving messages. This model is commonly used in distributed systems, where each processor has its own private memory space, and communication happens explicitly through message exchanges. Hereâ€™s a more in-depth exploration of the message passing model based on the presentation.

**Example**:
Two threads, Thread 1 and Thread 2, want to exchange data:
- **Thread 1**: Sends a message containing variable `X` to Thread 2.
- **Thread 2**: Receives the message from Thread 1 and stores the value of `X`.
In contrast to the shared address space model, where threads communicate via shared memory, message passing requires explicit actions to communicate.
